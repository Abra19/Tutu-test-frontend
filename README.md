### Project Description:

1. Some js tasks.

2. JS component - for sorting tables

  - Sorting by columns: when you click on a column name, the table rows are sorted in ascending order, when you click again, they are sorted in descending order. A graphic item or text message indicates the sorting direction.

  - Datas are displayed paginated, with a maximum of 50 items per page. A navigation feature is provided to navigate through the pages

  - Filtration: the component provides a text field into which the user may enter text and rows in the table whose data does not contain a substring entered by the user will be hidden. Re-filtering is done by clicking on the Find button.

  - When you click on a table row, field values are displayed in an additional box below the table.

  - The data is loaded into the table from the server.
